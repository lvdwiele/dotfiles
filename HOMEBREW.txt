### Homebrew

To fully make use of the aliases contained in this package, you need to install Homebrew.

Run this from the command line:

$ /usr/bin/ruby -e "$(/usr/bin/curl -fsSL https://raw.github.com/mxcl/homebrew/master/Library/Contributions/install_homebrew.rb)"

Read the script first if you like.

Then install the prereqs:

$ brew install nmap ngrep readline

And you're all set!
